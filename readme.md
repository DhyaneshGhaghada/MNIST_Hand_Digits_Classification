## About Project
This project is a Deep Learning Project based on CNN. In this project a model has been trained on [MNIST Hand Digits Classification Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). I created this project to learn about CNN in PyTorch on a bit deep level.

## How To Run Project
To run this project simply run MNIST_classification.py file.
There draw any number you want and after drawing the number simply press the 'classify' button and you will get the prediction on the top-right of the window. When you want to draw other number, just press the reset button and you are good to go :)
